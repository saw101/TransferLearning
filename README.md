## Problem Statement:
To classify the flower image classes (daisy, dandelion, roses, sunflowers, tulips) using Transfer Learning (TL).


The Pre-trained model used is [tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/classification](https://tfhub.dev/google/tf2-preview/mobilenet_v2/classification/4) available on Tensorflow hub.
Transfer Learning approach is adopted to classify the labels which gave an accuracy around 87% on test data.
